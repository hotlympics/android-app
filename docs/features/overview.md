## Technical Implementation

### Camera Integration
```kotlin
@Composable
fun CameraScreen(
    onPhotoCapture: (Uri) -> Unit
) {
    val analyzer = remember { 
        PhotoVerificationAnalyzer { result ->
            // Handle real-time verification
        }
    }
    
    CameraPreview(
        analyzer = analyzer,
        onCapture = onPhotoCapture
    )
}
```

### Rating Interface
```kotlin
@Composable
fun PhotoRatingScreen(
    viewModel: RatingViewModel = hiltViewModel()
) {
    val uiState by viewModel.uiState.collectAsState()
    
    when (val state = uiState) {
        is RatingUiState.Loading -> LoadingIndicator()
        is RatingUiState.Ready -> {
            PhotoComparison(
                leftPhoto = state.leftPhoto,
                rightPhoto = state.rightPhoto,
                onSelection = viewModel::submitRating
            )
        }
        is RatingUiState.Error -> ErrorMessage(state.message)
    }
}
```
